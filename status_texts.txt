i had enough faith in kenny, slasher and teej to know youo were going to be goated
but the movement is lowkey nice in this game
im going to be pissed if i have to unlock every attachment again next week
i think they should just change the speed of the slide and distance and buff the normal running speed
na youll keep your progression on other consoles next week
hope so ive been grinding out all my guns so i can fry on pc lmao
my boy kenny playing F1 rn lmaoo
Bruh im grinding from apac
